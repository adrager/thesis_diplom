The LHC has collected \lumi of proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV. A search for physics beyond the Standard Model with high energetic jets and large missing transverse energy takes advantage of this data. The background from Standard Model processes is estimated to a high precision using data-driven estimation methods. The prediction of the Standard Model background arising form \ttbar and \wpj events with unidentified electrons and muons from the involved \W-decay is presented in this thesis.\\
No excess above Standard Model expectation could be found. The results are interpreted within the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model and for Simplified Models excluding squark and qluino masses up to $\tilde q \approx 1.2$GeV and $\tilde g \approx 650$GeV.
