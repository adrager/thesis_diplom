In this thesis a method has been presented which is able to predict events including high energetic jets and not detected leptons from a $W$-decay in the final state. 
A muon control sample is selected on data and reweighted to predict the not detected electrons and muons using reconstruction and isolation efficiencies obtained from MC and with a Tag \& Probe method on data. 
The method has been improved in the context of higher pileup, more statistics and with increased \HT and \MHT cuts. Test have been performed to prove that the method is capable of estimating the background for very high pileup distributions and very high \HT and \MHT selections. These studies show that the method can be applied for the even higher expected pileup and \HT and \MHT cuts as expected for the 2012 data.\\ 
The method has been used together with the other background estimations (Sec. \ref{sec:all_bkg}) in a search for events hinting to physics beyond the SM with on the \lumi of data collected by the CMS detector in 2011. Since no excess over SM expectations has been observed, limits have been calculated in the cMSSM and Simplified models excluding first and second generation squark and qluino masses up to $\tilde q \approx 1.2$GeV and $\tilde g \approx 650$GeV. These limits are among the world wide most sensitive limits published up to date.\\
%To improve the results even further different parametrization of the efficiency for example in pileup activity can be studied.\\
The exclution of a very large fraction of the $m_0 , m_{1/2}$ plane for first and second generation squarks suggests to focus on the search for third generation squarks. A b-tag could be implemented to select two independent samples one with a b tag and the other without to become more sensitive to third generation SUSY which includes b-jets in the decay chain.\\
The increased center of mass energy in 2012 of $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and the expected invrease to 14 TeV in 2014 will increase the sensitivity of this analyses in the higher $m_0, m_{1/2}$ plane of the cMSSM and also for the Simplified Models.\\
Despite the fact that a large space in the cMSSM model framework has been excluded the search for physics beyond the SM will continue and especially for the more challenging search for third generation squarks the hunt is far from over.
